# RomeBot by Sidpatchy
This branch will contain a nearly complete rewrite of RomeBot. I have learned a lot since I started out with RomeBot and it could be made more organized than it currently is. 

Libraries are likely to remain the same, however, I will be using sLOUT (Sidpatchy's Library of Useful Things) to compliment RomeBot v2

Another key thing that I need to do with this version, mainly for readablity and future use, is to comment on the code. Right now I can *usually* figure out what is happening but others may not have the same luck.

I think I have another goal; compiling should be something that makes the bot customizable... even after the bot is compiled. Want to change the token? Now you can. Before you would have had to recompile it into an EXE (which is still dumb, like genuinely, I can't overstate how pointless compiling Python is).
