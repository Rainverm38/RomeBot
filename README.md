# RomeBot by Sidpatchy | Unstable Testing Branch

**This branch is now defunct. The features of it may eventually be ported over to production RomeBot, however, for now, this project is abandoned.**

I highly recommend that you don't use this in any environment that requires stability, or any for that matter. Unless you are testing the bot out looking for bugs, I recommend that you don't use this version, ever.

ALSO, I am fully aware that the way I am inserting data into the SQL code is super dangerous. I don't care in this case, though I probably should, since RomeBot never directly takes any user input. Everything that RomeBot will ever write to the database is and always will be predefined.

To host this bot you must have discord.py, asyncio, and datetime (the one bundled with Python works just fine.) installed, may God help you if you do, I have done absolutely zero bug testing so far. Since this early version of v2.0.0 is probably extremely unstable, just like me, you should probably use the version I host or host your own using the most recent release. You can invite the current release version to your Discord server using this link: https://discord.bots.gg/bots/511050489928876052

I should probably add that I'm not actually entirely unstable, just a little. You've gotta have some spice in your life.

Like really, don't use this.

I hate the name of this branch. It will not be called changes! next time.
