**This branch is defunct, it WILL NOT be updated. Please use the master branch instead.**

Get Started By Typing !help

RomeBot is a basic chat bot I created it to bring some more fun to my Discord Server, and... who doesn't need the Glory of Rome in everything they do?

Now including 25% more glory in the same package! Nowhere else can you find so much glory packed into such a small package. Only 15.9  kilobytes! 

Remember, Roma Invicta and Carthago Delanda Est!

I have no plans for new features but I will add them as I see fit

Written in Python using version 3.8(.0) using Discord.py

To host this bot you must have discord.py, asyncio, and datetime (the one bundled with Python works just fine.) installed. Alternatively, you can invite it to your Discord server using this link: https://discord.bots.gg/bots/511050489928876052
