You may want to compile one of my Discord bots for a number of reasons, the primary reason, perhaps, is to avoid having to install Python on the machine it will be run on. Either way, here is a small and rather undetailed guide on how to do that.

Windows (automatic):

Step 1:
To get a bot token head over to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications and create a bot if you haven't done so already.

Step 2:
Open the file titled compiler.bat. This will update pip, for any reason, if you don't want this, please remove the 6th line from the batch file.
It will immediately begin to install the libraries RomeBot needs to run, as well as the library we will use to compile RomeBot. This can take some time, be patient.

Step 3:
Wait for the script to finish and then place your config.yml in the same folder as RomeBot.exe, finally, double click it and it will start up!. 
Congratulations! You successfully compiled RomeBot

Windows (manual):

Step 1:
Ensure you have the most recent supported version of Python installed. Currently, RomeBot uses, and is tested with, Python 3.8, as a result I recommend using the most recent version of 3.8. But it should work with anything from 3.6-3.8.

Step 2:
Installing PyInstaller. You can use the command: 'pip install PyInstaller' or find it on PyPi if you don't trust me https://pypi.org/project/PyInstaller/

Step 3:
Modify the file 'RomeBot.py'

The last line of my Discord bots will, for the foreseeable future always be the line in which your bot token must be added.

To get a bot token head over to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications and create a bot if you haven't done so already.

Second, open RomeBot.py in a text editor of your choice, and replace the final line "bot.run('INSERT_TOKEN')" with "bot.run('exampletoken123')" ensure you do not remove the apostrophes. This will cause an error.

Then save the file and run it to make sure it works. If it does, congratulations, you are most of the way there.

Step 4:
I now recommend creating a separate directory (folder) and copying RomeBot.py to that.

Next, open up the command prompt in that directory using the command "cd C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Documents\CompiledBot" this requires modification on your part and assumes the folder is called "CompiledBot"

Step 5:
Now, enter "pyinstaller -F RomeBot.py" into the command line. This will compile RomeBot.

Step 6:
Open up the folder titled 'dist' and double click RomeBot.exe to open it.

Congratulations! You have successfully compiled RomeBot.
